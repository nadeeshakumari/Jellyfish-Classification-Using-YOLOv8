# 🪼 Jellyfish Image Classification using YOLOv8

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a deep learning image classification model using **Ultralytics YOLOv8** and a jellyfish image dataset from **Roboflow**. It includes data preparation, training, validation, and result visualization with rich matplotlib plots.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ YOLOv8 classification training on jellyfish dataset
- ✅ Roboflow integration for dataset management
- ✅ Confusion matrix, loss and accuracy plots
- ✅ Image class distribution visualization

## 🗂️ Dataset
- ✅ Downloaded from Roboflow using API.

- ✅ Dataset includes various jellyfish species:

  - Moon Jellyfish

  - Barrel Jellyfish

  - Blue Jellyfish

  - Compass Jellyfish

  - Lion's Mane Jellyfish

  - Mauve Stinger Jellyfish
 
## 📊 Visualizations
🔹 Confusion Matrix

🔹 Training Results

🔹 Validation Batch

🔹 Jellyfish Class Distribution


## 📌 Notes
- If using Kaggle, you may need to adjust the file paths.

- The yolov8n-cls.pt model is the YOLOv8 nano classification model.

- You can switch to yolov8s-cls.pt, yolov8m-cls.pt, etc., for better accuracy.
